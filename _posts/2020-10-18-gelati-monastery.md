I have so much to tell you. I'm making a mental list: all the places I've been, all the things you missed. I have so much to tell you about every year since you've been gone: I ran, I pushed people away and tried new things, I dove head first into following my dream, compartmentalizing and focusing. And now, I'm finally mustering up the strength to share with you all of these beautiful, horrible feelings. I have so much to tell you.
