I wonder if we would have traveled together. I wonder if years after we lived together, after we grew apart but still called each other best friend, we would have met up in a foreign, farfetched city. I wonder if you would have stayed at a hostel or if you would have preferred a hotel (you always preferred hotels). I wonder if we would have had another sunrise night like when we were 19, or if you would have insisted on something more mature, dinner and drinks, an early night. I wonder if you would have visited me now, thousands of miles away, made a vacation out of it, let me be your tour guide.
