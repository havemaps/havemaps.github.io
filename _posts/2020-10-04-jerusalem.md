I retreat, sometimes, into the depths of my mind. When I'm with people, it can happen without me noticing. One moment I'm present, and the next, I'm gone. Aren't you having any fun, someone asks. Why? To me, I only withdrew for a moment, but it was noticed.

I need to rest, sometimes, when I'm supposed to be having fun being alive. There have been times when I couldn't, wouldn't, refused, to match everyone else's energy. I need to rest, I say. To which I hear back: but it's once-in-a-lifetime. It wasn't, for me, anyway.
