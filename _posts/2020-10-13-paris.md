I think I need a change of scenery. Somewhere new to start my days. A new window to peer out. Different sounds rising up from the streets, humming through my curtains. I think I need a change of scenery. Maybe some place I've seen, or maybe somewhere I've never been. I think I need a change, but I don't know where to begin.
