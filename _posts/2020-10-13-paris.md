I think I need a change of scenery. Somewhere new to start my days. A new window to peer out. Different sounds rising up from the streets, humming through my curtains. I think I need a change of scenery. Maybe some place I've seen, or maybe somewhere I've never been. I think I need a change, but I don't know where to begin.

There are blanks in my mind. This listlessness lingers, entire years are gaps. Sometimes I struggle not only to write but also to think, to bring together the energy to ask myself "what do I want to eat." I'm so tired; tired from what? Life? Longing? Like I have put myself in hibernation, conserving energy. Conserving for what? If not now, when? If not then, when will I ever have the chance again?
