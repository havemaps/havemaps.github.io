I love the way the road changes when we cross state lines. Being alive feels so strange when I can't feel anything else at all. Even the way you love me doesn't feel any different than breathing. All we need is someone to dance with, but one day you will be looking at me from the shores of New Zealand (sometimes I feel so heavy). Today, we are too far from love to say, "Goodbye.""
