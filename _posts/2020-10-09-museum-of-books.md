I'm allowing myself to revisit memories, digging deeper into the depths of my mind's inner archives, pulling out some not-quite-so-profound-18-year-old's thoughts. Reflecting: have I changed, despite all that's gone on, gone wrong, gone? I'm the same as I've always been, but I tell myself, like copy and pasted poetry, you were beautiful despite your naïveté.
