It takes so much out of me, sustained creativity. I can spend a whole day, days, in bed before I am ready and capable of any actions again. It takes so much out of me, preparing for the aftermath: cook and freeze meals, clean the floors, do the laundry, take out the trash, schedule emails. In the end, I'm little more than capable of making the daily commute from my bed to the dining room table. Same clothes for days, trying to tuck my hair in a way that looks OK to the other end of my colleagues' cameras. It takes so much for me to find sustained creativity, but I have learned to ride the crash, coasting until I can catch another wave in the form of a hyper-stimulated brain.
