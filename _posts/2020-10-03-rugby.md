I'm quitting my job to become a writer, to work on that famous war novel I'm always telling everyone about. I'm moving to South Africa to find my muse. I will only wear white linen dresses. I will bury myself in my basement and take too many sleeping pills (but not too much). I will go on a two-week bender and write my most famous work on one scroll of paper. No editing is required. Straight to the publisher, please.
