![Five camels with saddles and bridles in front of the red carved sandstone rocks in Petra, Jordan.](https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-30-al-khazneh .JPG?raw=true "Petra, Jordan")

55 to the Red Line. Transfer to Blue. Trying to save a few dollars by taking public transit, losing time instead of money. I rationalize, this is the penny-pinching that will help me dig myself out from under my debts (is this picking myself up by my boot straps?). Careful preparation: will I make all my transfers? Will I make it in time before the start of the play?

After the play, drinks. After the drinks, a decision. My frugality and financial anxiety takes over again, refusing an offer to spend more time with a friend to take advantage of a ride-share coupon--it expires at midnight!

Months, or maybe it is years, later my mind is returning to this memory, wondering why there never was we, realizing I didn't turn down a midnight drink but a proposition, a potentiality. All for the sake of saving five dollars.
