![Foreground of image is a red rafflesia flower on forest floor. Mid and background is covered in dead leaves with the trunk of a tree in the back center](https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-21-sabah.jpg?raw=true "Rafflesia in Sabah, Malaysia")

Trying to live my life in triplicate gets exhausting when the energy doesn't ever come easy to live it enough for one, but I do what I can to take in what their senses never got to know. Sometimes I forget why my energy falls short of those around me, but when I remember what I carry with me (memories for three), I feel a spark in my momentary quiet, taking in the scenes (making memories for one, wishing them for three). I travel as a trio: two specters at my side unbeknownst to anyone I meet.
