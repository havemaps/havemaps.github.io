![Foreground is entirely black. Mid-photo is the Darvaza Gas Crater as seen from afar at night, glowing, and to the right are people standing at the surrounding fence. Background shows some lights from tents and a dark night sky.](https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/_site/img/2020-09-25-darvaza.JPG?raw=true "Darvaza Gas Crater, Turkmenistan")

Balancing on the border, I try to carry myself through each day. Working. Writing. Whatever. Always chasing a feeling, avoiding falling; often failing, but not falling. When I find my favorite mind, I wonder, how long do we have this time? A short burst, long enough to say yes, or something that will linger, forcing me to ask when I wake up each day in a continued heightened state: when will this end? I don't want this to end. It always ends.
