Lately, I have felt nostalgic for my teenage writing days.
Something about isolation---of miles and minds---has always tugged me back to old habits. Seven years on, my brain skips like a scratched CD, looking for somewhere safe to land.

Lately, I have wanted to return to a comfortable place, not with miles but with my mind. Feeling both comfort and betrayal in writing, it's becoming impossible to ignore the intrusive thoughts and prods, compartmentalizing has gone on long enough. Broken machinery and cheap reproductions are still part of me if I can only remember how to get them moving again.
