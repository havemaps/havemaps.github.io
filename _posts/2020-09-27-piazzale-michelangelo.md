A time lapse plays across my mind as I am making my way up to Piazzale Michelangelo. Moving through the Renaissance streets I'm quiet but projecting, trying to imagine my life as a Botticelli dreamscape. Pausing in front of Dante's childhood home, I dream of the places I have been, where I was, why I needed to run. Oh, Perseus, why?
