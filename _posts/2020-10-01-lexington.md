The desert air outside is dusty, humid, still stifling almost every day, but something inside: inside, it feels like autumn. Cool air lingers, the AC must be set just right. Inside, it feels like sweaters and sleeping with the windows open, a cool breeze to lull me to sleep each night and gently wake me up the next day. Something inside feels like the Southeast on an early October night. Maybe its my memory playing tricks on me, knowing I'm homesick---for a time, not a place.
