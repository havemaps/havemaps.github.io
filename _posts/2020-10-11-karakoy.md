City smells of black smoke from trucks, boats and buses; millions of people, fake perfumes, too strong aftershave, and lack of deodorant; various food stands, corn, lamb, fish, bread; gasoline; industrial and human waste. But if you go to the right places you might be able to breathe in a breath of fresh air. Lavender, jasmine, roses, fresh cut grass.
The sound is loud. Much too loud for my ears accustomed to suburban life. Constant chaos of construction. The moans and groans of construction equipment. The dull hum of a jackhammer and whir of a welding gun. The honking of buses, cars, dulmuş, and taxi. Break screeches. Horns blare from the ferry about to leave and the captain is on the intercom announcing the departure port. People pitter pattering from place to place. Birds singing, dogs barking, people yelling and selling: soğuk su elli kuruş.
