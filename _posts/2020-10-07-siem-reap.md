Nothing I said---because words were all I had---could make you keep a steady gaze on me. Eyes wander when first impressions aren't good enough. Let me waste my time leaving my last impression, making my imagined you wonder what if. Next week, I'll be looking for you across the South China Sea before I bury the fantasy in my memories of neverminds and wish I hads and only if I would have beens. I'll send a mental thank you note for making me feel the urgency, if not just an itch, to write anything again. One weekend was long enough to help resurface my mystical visions and cosmic vibrations.
