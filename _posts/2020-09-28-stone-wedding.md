Because being missed is a much greater feeling than being loved I kept my distance and never told you how I felt. Now, I'm gone and so are you, but you miss me like I love you. Blaming the rain on missed turns won't cover up the fact that these old roads aren't familiar anymore. Maybe this distance is what we've needed: A separation of miles, not minds. I swear you loved me once---your songs still play inside my head. Because I still think you might love me one day, [these are the songs I would play](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6ul1IOR2ltUyj9D8Ncc9hy?si=2dYW1vTFQSSiPfAOTRAuwQ){:target="_blank"}.
