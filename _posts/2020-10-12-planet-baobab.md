Chemicals in my brain are trying to tell my mind to change, to grow up and out of the childish delight and idealism that I've relished in for some thirty odd years now. My body craves rationality, but my mind holds on to the simplicity and ease of irrational thought. The world I know isnʼt real. Visions play inside my head alongside reality. When I wake up, into reality, my dreams will fall asleep, into an endless slumber (an endless summer). Maybe one day my mind will succumb to my bodyʼs urges for adulthood. Maybe one day my mind will no longer be frightened or entertained or find happiness or pain in imagination. But, for tonight, I will dream of aliens, Egyptians and eternity: Carl Sagan will narrate my passage through the universe and existence.
