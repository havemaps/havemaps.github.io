Turning the corner a mosaic catches my attention. Something about it felt familiar: memories of poster board, tiny pieces of construction paper, Elmer's glue, a rainy afternoon in the living room on the floor with my mom, Blockbuster rentals on in the background. I recreated the mosaic in defiance for a high school history project, a cheap reproduction. Finally, in front of me, I didn't even know I needed to see it. Gold tiles gleam; I think, the yellow and navy construction paper was a far cry from capturing the imagery. How many other innocuous artifacts may have had such a lasting impact?
