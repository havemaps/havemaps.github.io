## An itch
Nothing I said---because words were all I had---could make you keep a steady gaze on me, eyes wander when first impressions aren't good enough. Let me waste my time leaving my last impression, making my imagined you wonder what if. Next week, I'll be looking for you across the South China Sea before I bury the fantasy in my memories of neverminds and wish I hads and only if I would have beens. I'll send a mental thank you note for making me feel the urgency, if not just an itch, to write anything again. One weekend was long enough to help resurface my mystical visions and cosmic vibrations.

## Quiet
Quiet, like the snow. In the first few moments, blissful. In the next, exciting. As it sinks in, knowing it will have to melt (unless), but yet.
--April 2019, Abu Dhabi


## Coming of age in Italy
A time lapse plays across my mind: walking daily through Piazzale Michaelangelo.
Moving through the Renaissance streets I'm quiet but projecting, trying to imagine my life as a Botticelli dreamscape. Pausing in front of Dante's childhood home, I dream of the places I have been, where I was, why I needed to run. Oh, Perseus, why?

## Unclench your fists
To my mother and to my father, who are what I'll never be: You created the best of me.

# Life
When I look back on the best days of my life I want it to be nothing I ever thought it would be and everything I ever wanted it to be.
--March 2011, Murfreesboro

## Eternity
Your soul is not immortal. It's your body that lives on. What you're made of has been and always will be: from the beginning of forever until the end of eternity.
-- May 2011, Murfreesboro

I put a lot of pressure on myself to live up to the expectations I think other people have of me.


Just because you're a liar doesn't make you an actor.

My old journals are littered with your name. (Just like this one) I'm the same person I've always been.

If only I lived in reality then maybe I could have something real.

## It takes
It takes so much out of me, sustained creativity. I can spend a whole day, days, in bed before I am ready and capable of any actions again. It takes so much out of me, preparing for the aftermath: cook and freeze meals, clean the floors, do the laundry, take out the trash, schedule emails. In the end, I'm little more than capable of making the daily commute from my bed to the dining room table. Same clothes for days, trying to tuck my hair in a way that looks OK to the other end of my colleagues' cameras. It takes so much from me finding creativity, so I have learned to ride the crash, coasting until I can catch another wave in the form of a hyper-stimulated brain.

## On the border
Balancing on the border, I try to carry myself through each day. Working. Writing. Whatever. Always chasing a feeling, avoiding falling; often failing, but not falling.
When I find my favorite mind, I wonder, how long do we have this time? A short burst, long enough to say yes, or something that will linger, forcing me to ask when I wake up each day in a continued heightened state: when will this end? I don't want this to end. It always ends.

## Artifacts of influence
Turning the corner a mosaic catches my attention. Something about it felt familiar: memories of poster board, tiny pieces of construction paper, Elmer's glue, a rainy afternoon in the living room on the floor with my mom, Blockbuster rentals on in the background. I recreated the mosaic in defiance for a school project, a cheap reproduction. Finally, in front of me, I didn't even know I needed to see it. Gold tiles gleam; I think, the yellow and navy construction paper was a far cry from capturing the imagery. How many other innocuous artifacts may have had such a lasting impact?

## Lately in the past 7 years
Lately I have felt nostalgic for my old writing days.
Something about isolation--of miles and minds--has always tugged my fingers. Seven years on, my brain skips like a CD over the damaged parts, looking for somewhere safe to land.

Lately I have wanted to return to a comfortable place, not with miles but with my mind. Feeling both comfort and betrayal in writing, it's becoming impossible to ignore the intrusive thoughts and prods, compartmentalizing has gone on long enough. Broken machinery and cheap reproductions are still part of me if I can only remember how to how use them again.

## Living life in triplicate
Trying to live my life in triplicate gets exhausting when the energy doesn't ever come easy to live it enough for one, but I do what I can to take in what their senses never got to know. Sometimes I forget why my energy falls short of those around me, but when I remember what I carry with me (memories for three), I feel a spark in my momentary quiet, taking in the scenes (making memories for one, wishing them for three). I travel as a trio: two specters at my side unbeknownst to anyone I meet.
