    "body": "The project: Where can we go when we can’t go anywhere? Have Maps Will Travel is a digital storytelling project about escapism and memory as coping mechanisms for grief and instability. Presented in the style of a blog, the project combines writing, photography, and maps. Each post uses a place to anchor its theme. The often unconnected content in a post works together to create an almost imagined memory of the place. The interactive post map adds to the nonlinearity in the narrative, which allows readers to explore the author’s state of mind throughout time. The photos used in this project were taken by the project owner throughout the past 10 years. Most photos were taken with a variety of iPhones, but some used a Nikon CoolPix L22. This project is proudly open source and available on GitHub. It is built with Jekyll sites and Leaflet maps. If you have any questions, comments, or proposals for collaborations, contact the project owner.

These days it seems like my alternate reality is getting blurred with what people call the real world as asleep gets more confused with awake. You have been talking to me like this isn’t your first time with those pestering whys and hows and whos and whats.

I wonder if years after we lived together, after we grew apart but still called each other best friend, we would have met up in a foreign, farfetched city. I wonder if you would have stayed at a hostel or if you would have preferred a hotel (you always preferred hotels). I wonder if we would have had another sunrise night like when we were 19, or if you would have insisted on something more mature, dinner and drinks, an early night. I wonder if you would have visited me now, thousands of miles away, made a vacation out of it, let me be your tour guide. "

Aren’t you having any fun, someone asks. Why? To me, I only withdrew for a moment, but it was noticed. I need to rest, sometimes, when I’m supposed to be having fun being alive. There have been times when I couldn’t, wouldn’t, refused, to match everyone else’s energy. I need to rest, I say. To which I hear back: but it’s once-in-a-lifetime. It wasn’t, for me, anyway. "

Cool air lingers, the AC must be set just right. Inside, it feels like sweaters and sleeping with the windows open, a cool breeze to lull me to sleep each night and gently wake me up the next day. Something inside feels like the Southeast on an early October night. Maybe its my memory playing tricks on me, knowing I’m homesick—for a time, not a place. "

I rationalize, this is the penny-pinching that will help me dig myself out from under my debts (is this picking myself up by my boot straps?). Careful preparation: will I make all my transfers? Will I make it in time before the start of the play? After the play, drinks. After the drinks, a decision. My frugality and financial anxiety takes over again, refusing an offer to spend more time with a friend to take advantage of a ride-share coupon—it expires at midnight! Months, or maybe it is years, later my mind is returning to this memory, wondering why there never was we, realizing I didn’t turn down a midnight drink but a proposition, a potentiality. All for the sake of saving five dollars. "

Now, I’m gone and so are you, but you miss me like I love you. Blaming the rain on missed turns won’t cover up the fact that these old roads aren’t familiar anymore. Maybe this distance is what we’ve needed: A separation of miles, not minds. I swear you loved me once—your songs still play inside my head.

It takes so much out of me, preparing for the aftermath: cook and freeze meals, clean the floors, do the laundry, take out the trash, schedule emails. In the end, I’m little more than capable of making the daily commute from my bed to the dining room table. Same clothes for days, trying to tuck my hair in a way that looks OK to the other end of my colleagues’ cameras. It takes so much for me to find sustained creativity, so I have learned to ride the crash, coasting until I can catch another wave in the form of a hyper-stimulated brain. "

A short burst, long enough to say yes, or something that will linger, forcing me to ask when I wake up each day in a continued heightened state: when will this end? I don’t want this to end.

Something about it felt familiar: memories of poster board, tiny pieces of construction paper, Elmer’s glue, a rainy afternoon in the living room on the floor with my mom, Blockbuster rentals on in the background. I recreated the mosaic in defiance for a high school history project, a cheap reproduction. Finally, in front of me, I didn’t even know I needed to see it. Gold tiles gleam; I think, the yellow and navy construction paper was a far cry from capturing the imagery. How many other innocuous artifacts may have had such a lasting impact? "

Seven years on, my brain skips like a scratched CD, looking for somewhere safe to land. Lately, I have wanted to return to a comfortable place, not with miles but with my mind. Feeling both comfort and betrayal in writing, it’s becoming impossible to ignore the intrusive thoughts and prods, compartmentalizing has gone on long enough. Broken machinery and cheap reproductions are still part of me if I can only remember how to get them moving again. "
