        <title>Lexington</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-10-01-lexington.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Low angle photo of dozens of carved pumpkins on stone steps. &quot; title=&quot;Lexington, Kentucky&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desert air outside is dusty, humid, still stifling almost every day, but something inside: inside, it feels like autumn. Cool air lingers, the AC must be set just right. Inside, it feels like sweaters and sleeping with the windows open, a cool breeze to lull me to sleep each night and gently wake me up the next day. Something inside feels like the Southeast on an early October night. Maybe its my memory playing tricks on me, knowing I’m homesick—for a time, not a place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Al-Khazneh</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-30-al-khazneh.JPG?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Five camels with saddles and bridles in front of the red carved sandstone rocks in Petra, Jordan.&quot; title=&quot;Petra, Jordan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;55 to the Red Line. Transfer to Blue. Trying to save a few dollars by taking public transit, losing time instead of money. I rationalize, this is the penny-pinching that will help me dig myself out from under my debts (is this picking myself up by my boot straps?). Careful preparation: will I make all my transfers? Will I make it in time before the start of the play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the play, drinks. After the drinks, a decision. My frugality and financial anxiety takes over again, refusing an offer to spend more time with a friend to take advantage of a ride-share coupon—it expires at midnight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months, or maybe it is years, later my mind is returning to this memory, wondering why there never was we, realizing I didn’t turn down a midnight drink but a proposition, a potentiality. All for the sake of saving five dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-29-serowe.JPG?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Top two thirds is gradient sky from dark purple into pinks and then orange. Top left is a crescent moon. Bottom third is black outlines of savannah flora.&quot; title=&quot;Sunrise in Serowe, Botswana&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sleeping well these days. Something keeps me up at night. I can’t quiet my mind when there’s still so many thoughts to think like, what’s stopping me from sleep? Something keeps me up at night. I don’t know what, but it doesn’t wake me up in the morning either. Something keeps me up at night. I’m passing the time &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KgNENnu7NgSon3y7lZuqF?si=OaZs3rYKRnmUeyVZXgOpKQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dancing to the beat of my own mental break&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Stone Wedding</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-28-stone-wedding.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Photo from behind and below of the rock formation Stone Wedding. Small plants and shrubs on ground and some parts of rocks. Sky in upper quarter is light gray. &quot; title=&quot;The Stone Wedding&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because being missed is a much greater feeling than being loved I kept my distance and never told you how I felt. Now, I’m gone and so are you, but you miss me like I love you. Blaming the rain on missed turns won’t cover up the fact that these old roads aren’t familiar anymore. Maybe this distance is what we’ve needed: A separation of miles, not minds. I swear you loved me once—your songs still play inside my head. Because I still think you might love me one day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6ul1IOR2ltUyj9D8Ncc9hy?si=2dYW1vTFQSSiPfAOTRAuwQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;these are the songs I would play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Piazzale Michelangelo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-27-perseus.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of the Perseus With Medusa's Head bronze sculpture on top of white marble platform. Perseus stands upon Medusa's body and holds her head up. Background of photo shows outdoor pavilion overhead.&quot; title=&quot;Perseus with Medusa Head statue&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A time lapse plays across my mind as I am making my way up to Piazzale Michelangelo. Moving through the Renaissance streets I’m quiet but projecting, trying to imagine my life as a Botticelli dreamscape. Pausing in front of Dante’s childhood home, I dream of the places I have been, where I was, why I needed to run. Oh, Perseus, why?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mirissa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-26-mirissa.JPG?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Dog sleeping on the ground under a coconut tree. Background shows more coconut trees descending on a hill falling into blue ocean with crashing waves&quot; title=&quot;Sleeping dog at Coconut Hill, Mirissa, Sri Lanka&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes so much out of me, sustained creativity. I can spend a whole day, days, in bed before I am ready and capable of any actions again. It takes so much out of me, preparing for the aftermath: cook and freeze meals, clean the floors, do the laundry, take out the trash, schedule emails. In the end, I’m little more than capable of making the daily commute from my bed to the dining room table. Same clothes for days, trying to tuck my hair in a way that looks OK to the other end of my colleagues’ cameras. It takes so much for me to find sustained creativity, so I have learned to ride the crash, coasting until I can catch another wave in the form of a hyper-stimulated brain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Darvaza</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-25-darvaza.JPG?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Foreground is entirely black. Mid-photo is the Darvaza Gas Crater as seen from afar at night, glowing, and to the right are people standing at the surrounding fence. Background shows some lights from tents and a dark night sky.&quot; title=&quot;Darvaza Gas Crater, Turkmenistan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing on the border, I try to carry myself through each day. Working. Writing. Whatever. Always chasing a feeling, avoiding falling; often failing, but not falling. When I find my favorite mind, I wonder, how long do we have this time? A short burst, long enough to say yes, or something that will linger, forcing me to ask when I wake up each day in a continued heightened state: when will this end? I don’t want this to end. It always ends.&lt;/p&gt;

Mid-ground shows an in focus orange and black butterfly at the edge of the platform. Background is green foliage. &quot; title=&quot;Darling Harbour&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hagia Sophia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-23-hagia-sophia.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of Hagia Sophia's main hall taken from the uppper level. &quot; title=&quot;Hagia Sophia, Istanbul&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning the corner a mosaic catches my attention. Something about it felt familiar: memories of poster board, tiny pieces of construction paper, Elmer’s glue, a rainy afternoon in the living room on the floor with my mom, Blockbuster rentals on in the background. I recreated the mosaic in defiance for a high school history project, a cheap reproduction. Finally, in front of me, I didn’t even know I needed to see it. Gold tiles gleam; I think, the yellow and navy construction paper was a far cry from capturing the imagery. How many other innocuous artifacts may have had such a lasting impact?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Empty Quarter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io/blob/master/img/2020-09-22-empty-quarter.JPG?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Lower third is rolling golden sand dunes. Upper two thirds is a gradient blue sky.&quot; title=&quot;The Empty Quarter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have felt nostalgic for my teenage writing days.
Something about isolation—of miles and minds—has always tugged me back to old habits. Seven years on, my brain skips like a scratched CD, looking for somewhere safe to land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have wanted to return to a comfortable place, not with miles but with my mind. Feeling both comfort and betrayal in writing, it’s becoming impossible to ignore the intrusive thoughts and prods, compartmentalizing has gone on long enough. Broken machinery and cheap reproductions are still part of me if I can only remember how to get them moving again.&lt;/p&gt;
