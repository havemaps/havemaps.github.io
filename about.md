## The project
Where can we go when we canâ€™t go anywhere? Have Maps Will Travel is a digital storytelling project about escapism and memory as coping mechanisms for grief and instability. Presented in the style of a blog, the project combines writing, photography, and maps. Each post uses a place to anchor its theme. The often unconnected content in a post works together to create an almost imagined memory of the place. The interactive post map adds to the nonlinearity in the narrative, which allows readers to explore the author's state of mind throughout time.

The photos used in this project were taken by the project owner throughout the past 10 years. Most photos were taken with a variety of iPhones, but some used a Nikon CoolPix L22.

This project is proudly open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io). It is built with [Jekyll sites](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Leaflet maps](https://leafletjs.com/). If you have any questions, comments, or proposals for collaborations, [contact the project owner](mailto:havemaps@gmail.com).
