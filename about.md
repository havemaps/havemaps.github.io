## About the project
Where can we go when we canâ€™t go anywhere? This project seeks to capture escapism and memory with stream of consciousness writing, photography, and maps.

This project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io) and uses Jekyll sites and Leaflet maps.
