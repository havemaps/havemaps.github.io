## About the project
Where can we go when we canâ€™t go anywhere? This digital storytelling project seeks to capture escapism, memory, and wanderlust with stream of consciousness writing, photography, and maps.

This project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io) and uses [Jekyll sites](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Leaflet maps](https://leafletjs.com/).
