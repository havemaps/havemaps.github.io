## The project
Where can we go when we canâ€™t go anywhere? Have Maps Will Travel is a digital storytelling project about escapism and memory as coping mechanisms for grief and mental illness. Presented in the style of a blog, the project combines stream of consciousness, photography, and maps. Each post uses a place to anchor its theme. The often unconnected content in a post works together to create an almost imagined memory, continuously building upon the project's nonlinear narrative centered around the author's feelings of instability and isolation throughout time.

## Hosting
This project is proudly open source and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/havemaps/havemaps.github.io). It is built with [Jekyll sites](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Leaflet maps](https://leafletjs.com/).
